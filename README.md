# ***SKIDSCII*** **- A RANDOMIZED LANGUAGE FOR CODE PROTECTION**

## **WHAT IS** ***SKIDSCII***?
*SKIDSCII* is a unique randomized language designed to protect code from being hijacked and to add a layer of security through obfuscation. Itâ€™s specifically designed for environments like Discord bots, where code theft and token hijacking are common concerns. By using *SKIDSCII*, you can obfuscate your code in a way that makes it unreadable and nearly impossible for malicious users, such as skids, to reverse-engineer without your specific dictionary.

At its core, *SKIDSCII* is a randomized language, as in nobody's dictionary is the same. For one user, 'Apple' might be assigned the value 95, while for another user, it could be assigned 21. It generates unpredictable sequences, making the code much harder to crack without the correct dictionary. With its ability to handle different languages, symbols, and formats, *SKIDSCII* is both versatile and future-proof.

<sub>* *Note: This has not been extensively tested, but it is designed to be difficult to crack in theory.*</sub>

### Features:
* **Expandable:** Add whatever phrase you want to the *SKIDSCII* dictionary.
* **Works entirely offline**, with absolutely no need for internet access. (Internet connection is recommended to make use of APIs to enhance randomization.)
* **Allows code to function as usual** while being visually obfuscated and unintelligible to anyone who does not have access to your version of the randomly generated *SKIDSCII* dictionary.

## **WHY USE** ***SKIDSCII***?
* **Single Dependency:** *SKIDSCII*'s only dependency is [**Luvit**](https://luvit.io/) due to its built-in I/O capabilities. As a result, it may not run properly on other Lua environments without additional adjustments or extensions. It is recommended to use Luvit to ensure full compatibility with *SKIDSCII*.
* **Unique Approach:** *SKIDSCII* **does not** rely on traditional encryption algorithms, instead *SKIDSCII* uses a randomized language which assigns each line in `SKIDSCII_Template.txt` to a random number in `SKIDSCII_Dictionary.txt` which lets *SKIDSCII* know that said random number *actually* means something.

## **HOW DO I USE** ***SKIDSCII***?
### **1. Install Luvit**
* *SKIDSCII* is specifically designed to work with [**Luvit**](https://luvit.io/), a lightweight Lua runtime that includes built-in extensions like I/O, which are necessary for *SKIDSCII* to run properly.
* Download and install **Luvit** from the official website: https://luvit.io/.

### **2. Download** ***SKIDSCII***
* Clone or download the *SKIDSCII* repository from GitHub to your project folder (such as in VS Code).

### **3. Run the** ***SKIDSCII*** **randomize script**
* Add whatever you want to `SKIDSCII_Template.txt` in the same format as the examples where each new entry is indicated with a line break.
* In a Powershell terminal, navigate to the folder where `SKIDSCII_Randomize.lua` is located.
* Once Powershell is in the correct folder, run the following command:
   ```sh
   luvit SKIDSCII_Randomize.lua
   ```
* Check `SKIDSCII_Dictionary.txt` for changes. `SKIDSCII_Dictionary.txt` should close to this example:
   ```sh
   ["58"] = "Example 1"
   ["100"] = "Example 2"
   ["24"] = "Example 3"
   ```
